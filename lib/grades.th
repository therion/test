# UIS Grades - International standard grades specification
#   from: http://www.uisic.uis-speleo.org/UISmappingGrades.pdf
# Version 2 from 14 Sep 2012 (cosmetic update; UISv1 values still apply)
#
# Note: UIS standards says nothing about accuracy of the stations
#       positions, so it is probably good practice to include a
#       "sd position <value> <units>" definition in your centrelines.
#

# Grade -1: no map available
# Only for database purposes: It means that the cave map has not been drawn yet.
grade "UISv1_-1" -title "UISv1 ungraded survey without map"
  # Not applicaple for therion data.
  # It is mainly here to support automated data exports from
  # databases wich may export such a number.
endgrade


# Grade 0: ungraded
# Only for database purposes. If a cave survey is ungraded, its quality cannot be
# assessed. This is most usually true for historic or otherwise old maps.
grade "UISv1_0" -title "UISv1 ungraded survey"
  # Nothing defined here.
  # Specifying such an grade may be useful to document that the survey was
  # not graded. As it is documented in the *.th-datafiles it may easily be
  # searched for. Use it as a kind of "todo" flag...
endgrade


# Grade 1: sketch from memory, not to scale
grade "UISv1_1" -title "UISv1 survey grade 1"
  # nothing defined here.
  # Specifying such an grade may be useful to document that the survey was
  # just the result of a sketch and shpuld be redone.
endgrade


# Grade 2: No instruments, from annotations/sketches/estimates
# Map compiled from annotations, sketches and estimates made
# in the cave. No instruments used.
grade "UISv1_2" -title "UISv1 survey grade 2"
  # nothing defined here.
  # Specifying such an grade may be useful to document that the survey
  # was the result of sketches/annotations in the cave.
endgrade


# Grade 3: Rough magnetic/analogue survey
# Directions measured by compass, distances measured by chord,
# pace, or body dimensions. Significant slopes estimated.
#
# A Silva clinometer or comparable, relatively simple means without precise
# readings qualify for grade 3. Mapping from head to head of the surveyors
# qualifies only for grade 3. Topofil measurements qualify generally for
# grade 3 or 4.
grade "UISv1_3" -title "UISv1 survey grade 3"

  # 95.44% of readings are within 0.5m (2 S.D.)
  length 0.25 metres

  # 95.44% of readings are within 5.0 degrees (2 S.D.)
  bearing 2.50 degrees

  # 95.44% of readings are within 30.0 degrees (2 S.D.)
  # (estimating is allowed, no measurement needed - value guessed by me)
  gradient 15.0 degrees

  # UIS specifications say nothing about station position accuracy.
  # Add "sd position <value> <units>" to your centreline.

endgrade


# Grade 4: Magnetic survey
# Compass and tape survey, using deliberately chosen and fixed
# stations. Slopes measured by clinometer or horizontal and vertical
# components of line.
#
# Topofil measurements may qualify for grade 4 if the survey shots are not too 
# long and care is given to correctly read all data. Laser rangefinder can be
# used throughout grades 4 to 5. In order to attain grade 4, fixed and
# re-findable survey stations must be made. They have not to be necessarily on
# the walls; tripod-mounted points with a defined length above the floor are
# also accepted
grade "UISv1_4" -title "UISv1 survey grade 4"

  # 95.44% of readings are within 0.1m (2 S.D.)
  length 0.05 metres

  # 95.44% of readings are within 2.0 degrees (2 S.D.)
  bearing 1.00 degrees

  # 95.44% of readings are within 2.0 degrees (2 S.D.)
  gradient 1.00 degrees

  # UIS specifications say nothing about station position accuracy.
  # Add "sd position <value> <units>" to your centreline.

endgrade


# Grade 5:
# Compass and tape survey. Directions and slope by calibrated
# instruments, distances by fibreglass or metallic tape, or tachometry.
#
# Calibrated DistoX, DUSI or comparable instruments attain grade 5. With a
# calibration of the length measurement, they attain grade 6. If they are
# uncalibrated, they are to be graded with 1! Topofil used for vertical pits
# may reach grade 5. In order to reach grade 5, the survey coordinates have to
# be calculated (xyz coordinates, no polar coordinates plotted with scale rule
# a d protactor).
grade "UISv1_5" -title "UISv1 survey grade 5"

  # 95.44% of readings are within 0.05m (2 S.D.)
  length 0.025 metres

  # 95.44% of readings are within 1.0 degrees (2 S.D.)
  bearing 0.5 degrees

  # 95.44% of readings are within 1.0 degrees (2 S.D.)
  gradient 0.5 degrees

  # UIS specifications say nothing about station position accuracy.
  # Add "sd position <value> <units>" to your centreline.

endgrade


# Grade 6:
# Survey or triangulation using calibrated, tripod-mounted instruments
# for directions and slope. Distances by calibrated tape, precise
# tacheometry, or calibrated DistoX type (angles and length).
grade "UISv1_6" -title "UISv1 survey grade 6"

  # 95.44% of readings are within 0.02m (2 S.D.)
  length 0.01 metres

  # 95.44% of readings are within 0.25 degrees (2 S.D.)

  # 95.44% of readings are within 0.25 degrees (2 S.D.)

# Grade X: Survey by theodolite or comparable means
# Theodolite models or other similar equipment may vary as well as the measuring
# techniques. Therefore, all grade X surveys must include, in the written
# description of the cave, descriptions of the instruments and techniques used
# as well as an estimate of the probable accuracy of the survey.
grade "UISv1_X" -title "UISv1 survey grade X"
  # Details must be laid out at the survey.
  # custom "sd ... <value> <units>" have to be specified for your centrelines!
  #
  # That said, a construction site thedolite is about 0.08 gon
  # and a engineering theodolite about 0.02 gon.
  # Example: "sd bearing gradient 0.08 grad" # theodolite
